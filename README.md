# Game of Rings of Power

This project was created for the intermediate evaluation of Adalab's web development bootcamp.

This is a game in which the user can select a player from a list of 5 races of the Rings of Power, each with their own unique strength. When the user selects a player and clicks on 'begin battle', the computer randomly selects a fighter from the races in the Evil Army. The program then evaluates which player has greater strength and a message appears indicating whether 'the army of good won' or 'the army of evil won'.
